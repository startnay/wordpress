A highly documented plugin that demonstrates how to create custom admin list-tables from database using WP_List_Table class.

== Description ==
This plugin serves as a highly documented example of using WordPress's built-in WP_List_Table class with database CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for plugin development. This example serves to help clarify use of the WP_List_Table class with database for quickly and easily generating consistent, standardized, feature-rich list-tables for WordPress admin screens.

There are several great reasons to display your data in a list table like these:
1.Stays true to the WordPress core UI
2.Requires zero custom CSS
3.Takes less time to create than custom interfaces
